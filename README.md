# DataAnalytics
Data Analytics Projects I have worked on, I will keep on loading as long as I transcribe them into R or Python using SQL and Spreadsheets

If there is any tip or piece of advice, I will be more than happy to read it and if this can help anyone, Yay! that is the main purpose of this :)
